# Data Science: A Brief Introduction


## 
### What is Data Science?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
::: incremental

- an emergent field that blends multiple areas.  
- demands expertise in a range of skills and concepts spanning statistics, computer science, mathematics, and other domains (Mike and Hazzan, 2023).
- no agreement for a single definition because of its multifaceted nature.
-   A Venn diagram is typically used to help illustrate the interdisciplinary nature of data science as a discipline.

## 
### Data Science in Higher Education Context

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px"}
-   The interdisciplinary nature of data science has been discussed in data science education community (e.g., Asamoah et al., 2020)
    -   It brings unique challenges to determine the scope and content of data science courses/majors (Yan & Davis, 2019).
-   Some initiatives have been taken to provide curriculum guidelines for data science (e.g., De Veaux et al., 2017; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, 2018 ) and essential skills for a data scientist (e.g., De Veaux et al., 2017)
    -   More research on data science education is required
        -   to enhance the scope and
        -   to cultivate proficient data scientists who can meet the growing demand for data scientists in various professional fields.

__Undergraduate Data Science Education at the Policy Level__

:::
:::


## 
### Introduction

::: {style="font-size: 27px"}
::: {.incremental}

- Undergraduate data science education is a major focus in the data science education community. 

- Efforts being made to identify data science competencies such as
  - The Park City Math Institute report (De Veaux et al.2017), 
  - The Framework of National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2021), 
  - Association for Computing Machinery’s computing competencies guidelines (Danyluk et al.2021), and 
  - European Union’s EDISON project (Wiktorski et al.2017a). 
  - Accreditation Board for Engineering
and Technology’s (ABET’s) accreditation for data science programs (2024)

- A global call for need by many professional organizations and scholars to understand undergraduate data science education as well as the scientific literature on this topic.  

:::
:::

## Aim of the study 

In this project, the goals were to 

(1) specify current evidence and knowledge gaps in undergraduate data science education and 
(2) inform policymakers and data science educators/practitioners about the present status of data science education. 

We conducted a systematic literature review (Evans & Benefield, 2001; Liberati et al., 2009) by using certain criteria.


## Methodology

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

- __Systematic literature review__ is generally used for informing evidence-based decisions in a field by compiling all empirical evidence that fits pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria (Evans & Benefield, 2001; Liberati et al., 2009). 

::: fragment
  - This approach was selected within the context of the study because we aimed to 
      (1) to gain a deeper understanding to be able to specify current evidence and knowledge gaps; 
      (2) inform policymakers and data science educators/practitioners; and

# Knowledge Gaps

## 
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

__1. There is no suﬀicient empirical data:__ 44 studies out of 77 did not collect data. 

- Given the scopes of content areas such as calls to action, educational technology, and program examples coupled with the emergent nature of the field, the lack of empirical data is not a surprising finding. 

    - However, it also suggests that undergraduate data science educators have not yet begun collecting empirical data systematically.
    

::: fragment
    
::: {.callout-warning}

Emphasis on lack of empirical data is not a promotion of empiricism over all other ‘ways of knowing’.

What is being highlighting is the disproportionately high percentage of studies lacking empirical data, 

  - which complicates the literature’s potential for gaining a deeper understanding and identifying recurring patterns.
:::
:::
:::


## 
::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

__2. Reproducibility is one of the potential challenges in undergraduate data science education research:__ 
Speculatively, the absence of critical information about research designs, such as the lack of research questions, participants’ profile and non-collection of data may contribute to the reduced reproducibility of available studies. 

- One could argue that succinct nature of conference articles may inadvertently interfere with the comprehensive documentation necessary for the effective replication or modification of research.

- A potential reason for this gap may also be the minimal training that most instructors receive in reproducibility (Horton et al. 2022).

:::

##

::: {style="font-size: 30px"}

__3. Not all Data Science disciplines contribute equally to the overall body of knowledge:__  The prevailing trend indicates ongoing multidisciplinary collaborations. 

- Notably, computer science and data science emerge as the leading contributors to the literature. 
  - In contrast, fields such as statistics, mathematics, as well as other fields closely related to data science exhibit a limited presence in studies related to undergraduate data science education. 

- We believe that there are data science education studies in Statistics education community but they might not use this keyword "data science education" exclusively in their abstract/title/keywords etc. 

:::

## Recommendations 

Scientific studies are an integral part to review existing practices as well as to improve higher education institutions’ data science practices. Thus, we should

::: fragment

__Recommendation 1:__ Prioritize investments in empirical studies.
:::

::: fragment
__Recommendation 2:__ Diversify research efforts to enrich the spectrum of studies. 
:::

::: fragment
__Recommendation 3:__ Encourage scholars in key data science fields to contribute more to publications.

- Background and Motivation
- Aim of the Talk
- Recruitment and Data Collection 
- Similarities & Differences in 
  - Introductory Data Science (IDS) Courses
  - IDS Students
  - IDS Instructors
- Highlights and Shadows in IDS Teaching/Learning Environments


## Pedagogical Content Knowledge-I

::: {style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px"}
-   Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is one of the theoretical frameworks that provide an insight to an integration of content and pedagogy to teaching that enable instructors to monitor their teaching practices (Shulman, 1987).
-   In addition to content knowledge, it requires additional knowledge and skills.
-   In Magnusson et al.'s PCK model (1999) for science teaching, five components were specified as

(1) orientation toward teaching;
(2) knowledge of learners;
(3) knowledge of curriculum;
(4) knowledge of instructional strategies; and
(5) knowledge of assessment.

## Introduction to Data Science Courses

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
::: {.nonincremental}

<br> 

-   Introduction to Data Science (IDS) courses are introductory courses offered by different departments such as mathematics, statistics, data science, or computer science aiming to enable individuals to grasp the basics of data science.
    -   Even though majority of the enrolled students are from these departments, students are coming from almost every major/department to these courses.

## 
### Motivation Behind This Talk

<br>

::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 24px"}

_"I think introduction to data science is a pretty difficult course to teach... So, the other [intro course that I taught] was quite stable. But from my current experience with data science, stable will not be the word that I will describe."_ __[Participant 14]__
:::
 
<br>

::: {style="text-align: right; font-size: 24px"}

_"I hope that what I’m doing here [teaching IDS course] is useful"_ __[Participant 13]__
:::

<br>

::: {style="text-align: left; font-size: 24px"}

_I would say something I think about on this course a lot is… Is it necessary? Would students be better served by [other] classical intro data science course where they are doing [something else]. And I don't know the answer._ __[Participant 09]__
:::

<br>

::: {style="text-align: right; font-size: 24px"}

_I know that other people have different configurations of introductory  data science, and that includes ... some aspects of statistics. So, I am curious about ultimately what you [this research] find out about that, and what is the right configuration?_ __[Participant 07]__

![](img/lego-04.png){fig-align="center" width="40%"}

:::   

::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="font-size: 24px"}

- to provide a glimpse into the practices of introductory data science courses with __qualitative data__.

<br>

- to share range of examples across following dimensions:
    - content choices  
    - student background 
    - instructional approaches 
    - course capacity 

   

<br>

- __NOT__ prescribe the ideal configuration for IDS courses.
:::
:::
:::


## 
### Methodology


<br>

We chose __qualitative research design__ (Merriam, 2009).

<br> 

Our aim was to understand 

<br>

- how IDS instructors interpret their teaching experiences in IDS courses    

- “what meaning they attribute to their experiences” (Merriam, 2009, p. 23). 


## 
### Procedure to Recruit Participants

<br>

:::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {style="font-size: 32px"}

We recruited participants...

- who **taught an IDS course at least twice** at the undergraduate level.


- whose course titles included __Data Science__ and one of the following keywords: __Introduction, Principles, Elements or Fundamentals __

-  **16 participants** (2 pilot, 14 main study)

-  Gift card for their time.

# IDS Students

## 
### Who are IDS Students?

-   Students come from almost every major/department & every grade level.

    -   __Majority__ -- Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Data Science
    -   __Others__ -- Engineering, Business School, Social Science, Economics, Humanities, Life Sciences, Environmental Science, Political Science, Health Science, Undecided

## 
### Students' Difficulties in IDS Courses

-	Students without a programming background tend to spend more time learning coding.

- Almost every IDS student experiences difficulties in developing solid _strategic knowledge_*. 

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
  - __Strategic Knowledge:__ _integrating  syntactic knowledge  of  programming and conceptual  knowledge  of  disciplines  to  solve  novel problems  (Qian &Lehman,  2017)_.

:::

- More details are in our paper: [(Demirci et al., 2023)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/01p3k7f3). Learning Difficulties of Introductory Data Science Students.

## 
### Misconceptions and Stereotypes

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}


- Every IDS instructor shared their observations related to IDS students' misconceptions, stereotypes and possible sources.

__Some Example Statements__	

- If you can code quickly, you're a good data scientist. 

- They're either good or bad at data science (lack of growth mindset). 

- Data science is a field to be a collection of big hammers that if they learn how to swing each of these hammers, they could whack every problem in the world.

__Potential Sources:__ 

- Society, Popular Culture, Cultural Biases, Lack of Knowledge, YouTube...

## 

### Frustration and Challenges	of Students

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

"They are frustrated that it's not a simple task, very similar to math anxiety." __[Participant 04]__

<br>

"At first, they don't understand that programming is trial and error a lot." __[Participant 11]__

<br>

"Their motivation decreases when they see error message." __[Participant 11 & 12]__

<br>

"Sometimes they are frustrated when they failed to complete a task in R." __[Participant 15]__

#	Highlights and Shadows in IDS Education

## Highlights

![](img/9.png)

## Shadows

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 34px"}

- How do IDS instructors balance teaching in different class sizes and diverse majors?

- What is missing in large class sizes?

- Lack of guidelines/student learning outcomes for IDS Courses

  - Despite high self-efficacy beliefs, the IDS instructors wondered how well their course aligns with the growing consensus on 

    __“What should an introductory data science course be?”__
  
:::

## Conclusion

<br>

- We are still beta-testing __what to teach__ and __how to teach__ an IDS course.

  - More systematic studies in IDS education with empirical data are needed.
  
  - A policy-level document is required to guide us along the way.
